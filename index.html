<h2>How BLE Works in Retail Management</h2>

<p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is used in retail stores to connect with customers' smartphones through small devices called beacons.</p>

<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>BLE beacons are installed inside the store.</li>
  <li>Beacons send Bluetooth signals with a unique ID.</li>
  <li>Customer’s phone detects the beacon signal (if Bluetooth & store app are ON).</li>
  <li>The store app receives the signal and identifies the location or product area.</li>
  <li>Customer receives notifications like offers or product info.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Uses in Retail:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Personalized discount messages</li>
  <li>Indoor navigation (like Google Maps inside store)</li>
  <li>Fast and contactless billing</li>
  <li>Tracking customer movement patterns</li>
  <li>Product information pop-ups</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>If a customer comes near the shoe section, the store app may show:  
<strong>"20% OFF on Nike Shoes Today!"</strong></p>
